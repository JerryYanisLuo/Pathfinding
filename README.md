# Pathfinding
This project aims to animate various path finding algorithms

The path finding agorithm includes:
- A* search
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
- Greedy best first search.


The project also provides the function for generating maze. 

The maze generation algorithms includes:
- Depth-first search
- Prim's algorithm
- Recursive division algorithm
- Eller's algorithm
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Binary tree algorithm
- Sidewinder algorithm.


When using this software, you can easily specify the start point, end point and the wall. By choosing one of the algorithms and clicking the "visualize algorithm" button, the software will show you the complete amazing procedure how it find the best path.

The top right corner of the software presents the length of the path found and the time consumed(including animation time). Note that depth-first search and greedy best first search cannot guarantee the shortest path.

This project focus on its power function, though the user interface is designed as simple as possible. Hopefully, the UI part will be improved in the future.
